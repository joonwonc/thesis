In this dissertation, we discussed difficulties in designing and proving hardware cache-coherence protocols, proposed a methodology to ease the burden, and demonstrated it by building a framework \hemiola{} within the Coq proof assistant.
We also designed and proved various hierarchical cache-coherence protocols on top of the framework and synthesized them using the protocol compiler provided by the framework.

As the last chapter, we summarize each previous chapter and discuss a number of future-work directions.
Afterwards, we conclude by adding remarks, recalling our introduction to why hardware verification is complex.

\subsubsection{Chapter summaries}

We began with constructing an underlying basis to reason about hardware cache-coherence protocols.
We defined the protocol transition systems in \autoref{sec-trs}, viewing cache-coherence protocols as message-passing systems.
A system consists of objects, and the objects communicate by ordered message channels.
Local state transitions within an object are performed by rules, each of which has a precondition and a transition function.
In a protocol transition system, thanks to the so-called one-rule-at-a-time semantics, it is safe to assume that a state-transition step of a system is always made nondeterministically by a rule in an object.

On top of the protocol transition system, we provided the formal definition of serializability in \autoref{sec-sz-def}.
A memory subsystem consists of several caches and the main memory, and a cache-coherence protocol defined within the system allows to handle multiple memory requests concurrently in a distributed way.
Viewing cache-coherence protocols as distributed protocols, we call such concurrent execution interleaved, and the serializability property guarantees that any interleaving can be interpreted as a sequence of transaction executions by reaching the same resulting state.
We also provided a novel mechanism to prove invariants, called predicate messages, and demonstrated that it is much easier to state and prove predicate-message invariants in a serializable system.

As the next part of this dissertation, we established a framework called \hemiola{}, embedded in the Coq proof assistant, to design and prove cache-coherence protocols more easily.
Even if serializability can ease the burden of stating and proving invariants, it will still be a large burden if a user has to prove serializability per-protocol.
Thus we presented the \hemiola{} DSL in \autoref{sec-hemiola-dsl}, where any protocol defined by the DSL automatically obtains the serializability property for free.
The DSL contains the rule templates, each of which takes input messages, sets/releases locks, and makes output messages properly to satisfy serializability.

We provided the full mechanized Coq proof in \autoref{sec-sz-guarantee-hemiola} that the use of the rule templates indeed implies serializability, using the well-known technique called commuting reductions.
This implication theorem is the biggest theorem in \hemiola{}, but the theorem is general in that it can be applied to any protocol defined using the rule templates.
Commuting reductions are the most basic notion of noninterference between two adjacent state transitions, and the serializability proof employs them by showing that any interleaved history by a system defined with the \hemiola{} DSL can be reduced to a sequential history that reaches the same state, by a finite number of reductions.
In order to show that finitely many reductions suffice, we developed the notion of mergeability to figure out which two atomic-history fragments to merge while not breaking the other fragments.

The final part of this dissertation was to design and synthesize hierarchical cache-coherence protocols as case studies.
We defined three hierarchical protocols on top of \hemiola{}: inclusive and noninclusive MSI protocols and a noninclusive MESI protocol.
All of the protocols require a similar set of invariants in common: the exclusiveness, the sharing, and the invalidness invariants.
We provided in \autoref{sec-case-study} the complete correctness proofs of the protocols using these invariants and demonstrated that predicate messages help prove the invariants.

Lastly, the case-study protocols were compiled to corresponding hardware implementations and synthesized to run on FPGAs.
In \autoref{sec-comp-syn}, we developed the protocol compiler, which takes a single-line \hemiola{} protocol and generates a multiline implementation defined in the Kami hardware-verification framework.
The compiler employs a number of prebuilt hardware components also defined in Kami, which include noninclusive caches, inclusive directories, MSHR controllers, and so on.
Furthermore, we synthesized compiled Kami protocol implementations by borrowing the toolchains in Kami and Bluespec.
Our evaluation shows that the implementations are competitive with a practical implementation coded by hand.

\subsubsection{Future work}

There are a number of valuable future-work directions to make the \hemiola{} framework more robust.
First of all, as already mentioned in \autoref{sec-compiler-correctness}, we plan to prove the correctness of the protocol compiler.
The compiler correctness proof will be used eventually for proving the correctness of low-level cache-coherent memory subsystems compiled from the \hemiola{} protocols.

Another important future direction is to prove liveness of the protocols designed in Hemiola.
Even though we designed the rule templates carefully to avoid deadlocks, we think a formal proof should be supported by the framework as well.
Proving liveness generally requires deadlock, livelock, and starvation freedom.
Even though such properties should be properly stated and proven for low-level hardware implementations, it will be interesting to explore whether some properties in the protocol-description level can help proving the liveness or not.

The last future work is to extend the rule templates to cover more sophisticated message-communication patterns.
Highly optimized cache-coherence protocols often require message-communication patterns that cannot be performed by the current rule templates.
For instance, some protocols require direct communication among siblings (\ie{} not arbitrated by the parent), and no rule templates support it.
Extending the rule templates will require the extension of the serializability proof, which includes adding rule-template cases for each invariant proof.
