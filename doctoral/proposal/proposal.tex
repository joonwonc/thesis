\def\abstract{
  Hardware cache-coherence protocols provide the illusion of shared memory address spaces with atomic word-level access.
  Under the hood, we often find multiple memory-access transactions executed in a distributed manner, across the levels of a cache hierarchy, and this source of concurrency is one of the greatest challenges in formal verification of cache coherence.
  We introduce Hemiola, a framework for designing, proving, and synthesizing cache-coherence protocols, where a central reasoning principle is provided by the framework, allowing a user to prove a specific protocol assuming that \emph{memory accesses come one-at-a-time}.
  At the framework level, using commuting reductions, we prove that any state reachable with concurrent memory access is also reachable with serialized memory access.
  The proof relies on conditions on the protocol topology and state-change rules, but we have designed a domain-specific protocol language that guides the user to design protocols that satisfy these properties by construction.
  We implemented Hemiola as a framework embedded in Coq and used it to design and prove hierarchical noninclusive MSI and MESI protocols as case studies.
