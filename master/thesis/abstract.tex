Traditional RTL designs require hardware designers to consider
scheduling for all resources, which can be a large burden. In order to
make up for such shortcoming, a design paradigm known as Guarded
Atomic Action (GAA) was developed. Various verification works and
hardware semantics have been provided on the paradigm of GAA, but no
one seems to provide such semantics formally and to organize them with
respect to their exact usages. Hence I propose to introduce a number
of hardware semantics, to compare their pros and cons, and to discuss
their correctness.
