\paragraph{Discussion on the Performance of Inlining}

The inlining operator manipulates module definitions in a static way,
thus it requires computation.

In Coq proof system in which \Kami{} is built, variables make the
computation stuck.

In order to solve the issue, a rewriting lemma was defined and has
been used to rewrite variable terms.

However, because of the rewriting, the inlining operator lost its original
performance. \todo{80/20 percentage comparison}

This problem has been mentioned, but no proper solutions were
suggested yet.

\paragraph{Discussion on the Inlining and Synthesis}

Inlining should be used only for proofs, not for synthesis.

\paragraph{Future works}

Optimization

Applying inlining to other real examples

\paragraph{Conclusions}

Ipsum.
