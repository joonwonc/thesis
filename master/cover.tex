  Brief Statement of the Problem:

  Hardware system verification has been developed over a large amount
  of years, but mostly with limited approaches. In order to develop a
  general verification, defining formal hardware semantics is the very
  first step to answer such question. I propose to introduce a number
  of hardware semantics, to compare their pros and cons, and to give
  consistency proofs for the validity of semantics.\dbsp
  
  Supervision Agreement:

  The program outlined in this proposal is adequate for a Master's
  thesis. The supplies and facilities required are available, and I am
  willing to supervise the research and evaluate the thesis
  report.\dbsp
