  Brief Statement of the Problem:

  %% Hardware system verification has been developed over a large amount
  %% of years, but mostly with limited approaches. In order to develop a
  %% general verification framework, formal semantics should be defined
  %% as a first step. I propose to introduce a number of hardware
  %% semantics, to compare their pros and cons, and to give consistency
  %% proofs for the validity of semantics.\dbsp

  Traditional RTL designs require hardware designers to consider
  scheduling for all resources, which can be a large burden. In order
  to make up for such shortcoming, a design paradigm known as Guarded
  Atomic Action (GAA) was developed. Various verification works and
  hardware semantics have been provided on the paradigm of GAA, but no
  one seems to provide such semantics formally and to organize them
  with respect to their exact usages. Hence I propose to introduce a
  number of hardware semantics, to compare their pros and cons, and to
  discuss their correctness.\dbsp

  Supervision Agreement:

  The program outlined in this proposal is adequate for a Master's
  thesis. The supplies and facilities required are available, and I am
  willing to supervise the research and evaluate the thesis
  report.\dbsp
